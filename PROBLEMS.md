The parabola with equation $p(x) = a x^2 + b x + c$ and vertex $(h, k)$
is reflected about the line $y = k$.
This results in the parabola with equation $q(x) = d x^2 + e x + f$.
Which of the following equals $a + b + c + d + e + f$?
(A) $2 b$
(B) $2 c$
(C) $2 a + 2 b$
(D) $2 h$
(E) $2 k$

What is $k$?

Mrs. Walter gave an exam in a mathematics class of five students.
She entered the scores in random order into a spreadsheet,
which recalculated the class average after each score was entered.
Mrs. Walter noticed that after each score was entered, the average was always an integer.
The scores (listed in ascending order) were 71, 76, 80, 82, and 91.
What was the last score Mrs. Walters entered?
(A) 71
(B) 76
(C) 80
(D) 82
(E) 91

Cities A and B are 45 miles apart.
Alicia lives in A and Beth lives in B.
Alicia bikes towards B at 18 miles per hour.
Leaving at the same time, Beth bikes toward A at 12 miles per hour.

(A) 20
(B) 24
(C) 25
(D) 26
