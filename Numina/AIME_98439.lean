/- Alpha and Beta both took part in a two-day problem-solving competition.
At the end of the second day, each had attempted questions worth a total of 500 points.
Alpha scored 160 points out of 300 points attempted on the first day,
and scored 140 points out of 200 points attempted on the second day.
Beta who did not attempt 300 points on the first day,
had a positive integer score on each of the two days,
and Beta's daily success rate (points scored divided by points attempted)
on each day was less than Alpha's on that day.
Alpha's two-day success ratio was 300/500 = 3/5.
The largest possible two-day success ratio that Beta could achieve is m / n, where
m and n are relatively prime positive integers. What is m + n? -/
